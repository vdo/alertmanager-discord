# alertmanager-discord

Give this a webhook (with the DISCORD_WEBHOOK environment variable) and point it as a webhook on alertmanager, and it will post your alerts into a discord channel for you as they trigger:

Example alert manager config:

```
global:
  # The smarthost and SMTP sender used for mail notifications.
  smtp_smarthost: 'localhost:25'
  smtp_from: 'alertmanager@example.org'
  smtp_auth_username: 'alertmanager'
  smtp_auth_password: 'password'

# The directory from which notification templates are read.
templates:
- '/etc/alertmanager/template/*.tmpl'

# The root route on which each incoming alert enters.
route:
  group_by: ['alertname']
  group_wait: 20s
  group_interval: 5m
  repeat_interval: 3h
  receiver: discord_webhook

receivers:
- name: 'discord_webhook'
  webhook_configs:
  - url: 'http://localhost:9094'
```
